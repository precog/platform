Precog Labcoat desktop edition
==================================

Introduction
------------
This bundle includes two very powerful data analytics tools: the Precog analytics platform and Labcoat interactive data explorer.


Precog
-------
Precog is an analytics platform for semi-structured data. 
The platform includes APIs for building analytical apps, and a phenomenal toolset for data science.

What kind of analytics can Precog do?
Precog lets you perform data wrangling, data integration, historical analytics, and predictive analytics. 
Although Precog has many common analytics built-in, Precog doesn't limit you to a finite number of analytics, 
like other solutions. Instead, Precog has industry-leading support for Quirrel, 
the easy "R for big data" statistical language that will make you fall in love with data analysis.

Labcoat
-------

Labcoat is an HTML5 application that comes bundled in the
download. You don’t have to use Labcoat, of course, since Precog has a
REST API, but Labcoat is the best way to interactively explore your
data and develop Quirrel queries.

How to run...
-------------------
Once the program is sucessfully installed, Precog services will start in background and a launcher icon for Labcoat will be available in your menu. 

Analyze Data!
---------------------

Once you’ve got Labcoat running, you’re all set! You should see your 
collections in the file system explorer, and you can query
data from the collections, develop queries to analyze the data, and
export queries as code that run against your Precog server.


Precog is a beta product, and the Desktop edition is hot off the
press. You may encounter a few rough corners, and if so, we’d love to
hear about them (just send an email to support@precog.com).

Have fun analyzing!
