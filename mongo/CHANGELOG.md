Precog for MongoDB Changelog
==========

Version 1.0.5
----------
* Add support for database authentication for MongoDB (see README.md for configuration details)
* Improve performance of field filtering. For example, running a `count(load("/foo/bar").test)` will generally perform faster than `count(//foo/bar)`, since mongo will only load the `test` property instead of whole documents.

Version 1.0.4
----------
* Fix a bug in the quirrel solver that could cause hangs or invalid results
